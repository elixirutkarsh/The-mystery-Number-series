# The-mystery-Number-series
You are given a sequence of numbers, but the pattern that generates the series is unknown. Your task is to analyze the sequence and identify the pattern to find the next number in the series.

Sequence: 3, 8, 15, 24, 35, ?

Let's analyze the given sequence: 3, 8, 15, 24, 35, ?

To identify the pattern, let's find the difference between consecutive numbers:

8 - 3 = 5
15 - 8 = 7
24 - 15 = 9
35 - 24 = 11

From the differences, we can see that each number is increasing by consecutive odd numbers (5, 7, 9, 11, ...). This pattern suggests that the differences between consecutive numbers are in an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 2.

Now, let's find the difference between 35 and the next number in the sequence:

Next number - 35 = ?

We can continue the arithmetic sequence:

35 + 13 = 48

So, the next number in the sequence is 48.

The completed sequence is: 3, 8, 15, 24, 35, 48.
